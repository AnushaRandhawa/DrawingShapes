# DrawingShapes
The program uses Graphics, JPanel and JFrame libraries to create random coloured shapes on user's command.

This is a simple drawing program that draws shapes on screen. It draws a Rectangle, Circle and a Triangle and uses OOP concepts to achieve the objective.
Click and drag to draw a Rectangle and a Circle.
Click three times on the canvas to draw a Triangle. As you click, a line will be drawn from the point to the position of your mouse till you click again. On third click, the triangle will be made.
All drawn shapes will be filled with random colors and will be stored in a stack implementation.
Stack and Queue implementations are employed for Redo and Undo methods.
The clear method clears the canvas.
